# User and Epic Stories

## User Stories

A user story is the smallest unit of work in an agile framework, though they can be used in other methodologies. It is often an end goal expressed from the software user's perspective.

They are an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user or customer.


### Benefits Of Creating User Stories

* **Keeps the focus on the user:**
	* Compared to a general to-do list, the stories keep the team focussed on solving problems for real users.
* **Enable collaboration:**
	* End goal defined, team can work together to determine how best to serve the user and meet that goal.
* **Drive creative solutions:**
	* Encourage critical and creative thinking about how best to solve towards an end goal.
* **Create momentum:**
	* Every story checked off, can enjoy a small win, thus driving momentum.

## Epic Stories

In short, an epic is an body of work that can be broken down into specific tasks (user stories) based upon the needs and requests of customers or end users. They can be a helpful way to organise work and create a hierarchy so that work can be broken down into shippable pieces so that large projects can get done on time and can continue to be shipped to customers on a regular basis.


**_Epics help teams break their work down, while continuing  to work towards a bigger goal._**

# How Do User and Epic Stories Fit In With Agile and SCRUM?

Agile methodologies can implement user and epic stories to guide the and manage the scope and structure of work within an organisation. Given that user stories are short requirements written from the perspective of an end user, and epics are large bodies of work that break down into stories; these can be used to guide short-term sprints (as in SCRUM). For example, an epic can be a sprint which is to 'update the UI the devices which view and use the website' with the user stories comprising ofeach task in the sprint .e.g. user A wants to access from a large iOS device. Epics themself in agile help the team understand how, why and what is required for the completion of a project which should reduce any potential issues for the team arising from miscommunication since it is all within the team.
