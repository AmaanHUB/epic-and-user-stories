# Epic and User Stories

## User Stories

A user story is the smallest unit of work in an agile framework, though they can be used in other methodologies. It is often an end goal expressed from the software user's perspective.

They are an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user or customer.


### Benefits Of Creating User Stories

* **Keeps the focus on the user:**
	* Compared to a general to-do list, the stories keep the team focussed on solving problems for real users.
* **Enable collaboration:**
	* End goal defined, team can work together to determine how best to serve the user and meet that goal.
* **Drive creative solutions:**
	* Encourage critical and creative thinking about how best to solve towards an end goal.
* **Create momentum:**
	* Every story checked off, can enjoy a small win, thus driving momentum.
