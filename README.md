# User and Epic Stories

## User Stories

A user story is the smallest unit of work in an agile framework, though they can be used in other methodologies. It is often an end goal expressed from the software user's perspective.

They are an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user or customer.


### Benefits Of Creating User Stories

* **Keeps the focus on the user:**
	* Compared to a general to-do list, the stories keep the team focussed on solving problems for real users.
* **Enable collaboration:**
	* End goal defined, team can work together to determine how best to serve the user and meet that goal.
* **Drive creative solutions:**
	* Encourage critical and creative thinking about how best to solve towards an end goal.
* **Create momentum:**
	* Every story checked off, can enjoy a small win, thus driving momentum.

## Epic Stories

In short, an epic is an body of work that can be broken down into specific tasks (user stories) based upon the needs and requests of customers or end users. They can be a helpful way to organise work and create a hierarchy so that work can be broken down into shippable pieces so that large projects can get done on time and can continue to be shipped to customers on a regular basis.
